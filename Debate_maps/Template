Title: Gun control - Pro

Point1A: Non-military citizens don't need access to assault rifles.
Rebuttal1A: It is our constitutional right to bear arms.
-Point1B: We have limited the 2nd amendment right based on reason. For example, citizens can't buy tanks. For the same reason they shouldn't be allowed to buy assault rifles - the massive potential to cause harm.
-Rebuttal1B: If you outlaw assault rifles then only outlaws will have assault rifles
--Point1C: Do outlaws have tanks? RPGs? 50 cals?
--Rebuttal1C(Point2A): No, but it's too late anyway.

Point2A: Look at Australia, they banned assault weapons and haven't had a mass shooting since.
Rebuttal2A: It's too late for the US, we already have too many guns in circulation.
