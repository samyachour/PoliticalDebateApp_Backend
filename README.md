## Political debate app (backend)

This repo is the master as well as the backend for each of the 3 frontend repos ([web](https://github.com/samyachour/PoliticalDebateApp_Web), [iOS](https://github.com/samyachour/PoliticalDebateApp_iOS), and [Android](https://github.com/samyachour/PoliticalDebateApp_Android)).

Each repo has a [kanban board](https://github.com/samyachour/PoliticalDebateApp_Backend/projects/1?fullscreen=true) for task management that is automatically managed by issues & pull requests. This repo (backend) doubles as the master and has an extra list for project wide tasks. It also indexes all our debate map documents.

## Framework

For our backend we use a Django REST-API.
